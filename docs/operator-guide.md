# Operator Guide

## Setup

1. Install the package.
2. Set `HERMES_VAULT_PASSPHRASE`.
3. Run `hermes-vault list` once to initialize the runtime layout and default policy.
4. Edit `~/.hermes/hermes-vault-data/policy.yaml` for the real agent allowlists.
5. Back up both `vault.db` and `master_key_salt.bin` together. Losing the salt makes the vault unreadable.

## Recommended First Run

```bash
hermes-vault scan --path ~/.hermes
hermes-vault import --from-env ~/.hermes/.env
hermes-vault verify --all
hermes-vault generate-skill --all-agents
```

## Policy Notes

- Policy is deny by default
- Keep `raw_secret_access: false` unless there is a concrete operational reason
- Keep `require_verification_before_reauth: true`
- Keep TTLs short for sub-agents
- Use `plaintext_migration_paths` only for short-lived cutovers
- Treat plaintext under `managed_paths` as a policy violation unless explicitly exempted

## Troubleshooting

### "No passphrase available"

- Export `HERMES_VAULT_PASSPHRASE`
- Or run a command that prompts interactively, such as `add` or `import`

### "Vault database exists but salt file is missing"

- Restore `master_key_salt.bin` from backup
- Do not generate a new salt for an existing database
- If the salt is lost, the existing encrypted vault records are not recoverable

### "Credential not found in vault"

- Import or add the credential first
- Stop relying on filesystem discovery

### "Verification returned network failure"

- Do not tell the agent to re-auth
- Check connectivity and provider reachability first

### "Verification returned permission or scope issue"

- Do not tell the agent to re-auth
- Check scopes, app permissions, and provider authorization details instead

### "MiniMax verification endpoint is not configured"

- Set `HERMES_VAULT_MINIMAX_VERIFY_URL` before running `hermes-vault verify --service minimax`
- Point it at an operator-validated authenticated GET endpoint that returns `200` for valid credentials and `401` or `403` for invalid ones
- If you are testing an OpenAI-compatible MiniMax deployment, `/v1/models` is a candidate endpoint to validate, not an assumed contract

### "Broker denied access"

- Read the exact denial reason
- Update policy only if the service should genuinely be available to that agent

## Safe Operating Defaults

- Scan and import first
- Verify before any re-auth recommendation
- Use broker env materialization for tasks
- Keep audit records for false-auth troubleshooting
- Treat generated skills as review artifacts unless you explicitly install them
